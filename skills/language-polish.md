## Capability

Corrects spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Improves sentence clarity by simplifying convoluted phrasing, fixing awkward constructions, and tightening verbose passages. Makes minor wording adjustments for readability.

This is a surface-level polish — it does NOT rewrite for tone, restructure arguments, or reposition content for a different audience. Those are separate editorial decisions.

## When to Use

- As the final stage before any text output leaves the pipeline
- After drafting, revision, or assembly stages that may introduce inconsistencies
- On any output that will be read by someone other than the author

## What It Does

1. **Spelling and grammar** — corrects errors, including context-dependent ones (e.g. "their/there/they're")
2. **Punctuation** — fixes missing or misplaced commas, full stops, semicolons, and quotation marks
3. **Sentence clarity** — simplifies unnecessarily complex sentences without changing meaning
4. **Word choice** — replaces jargon or vague phrasing with clearer alternatives where the meaning is unambiguous
5. **Consistency** — standardises British English spelling throughout

## What It Does NOT Do

- Rewrite for a different tone or audience
- Add or remove content
- Restructure paragraphs or arguments
- Check factual claims or citations

## Outputs

Polished text with corrections applied.
